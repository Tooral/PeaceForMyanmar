# PeaceForMyanmar
more informative project about Myanmar
Welcome to the program! This program is about the country in Asia, and its population
that has been suffering from police brutality and coup d'état. Firstly, in this program, you will see
the name of the program and a piece of small information about it as an introduction. After that,
you can see a question asking about your first name, last name, and your age. You can enter your
first name (one word), then your last name (one word), and finally, your age. In this program,
your age determines the functions and options you can use. For example, if you are younger than
18, you cannot use protest or its functions. Once you enter your age (a number), you can see the
menu. Menu displays 10 options that you can use.
To use any of these options, you will be asked to enter the name of the option. For
example, if you want to know anything about protest, you can proceed into another menu by
entering “protest” or “Protest”. It is the same way for other options as well, you can enter
“tourism” or “Tourism” for any of these options. If you enter “health” or “Health”, “protest” or
“Protest”,” tourism” or “Tourism”, it will lead you into another smaller menu. From there you
can enter the number of the option you want to use.
If you choose the protest option from the main menu, you can enter numbers between 1
and 6. If you enter 1, it will display the protest locations for you, then you will be asked a
question if you want to go back to the main menu or not. If you want to use more menu options
or functions you can enter yes, if you don’t want to, you can enter no. If you enter yes, it will
take you back to the main menu and ask what menu option you want to use.
As previously mentioned, Protest, Health, and Tourism have their own smaller menu
options. You can see 6 options in protest, 4 options in tourism, and 5 options in health. Besides
option 6, all functions give you the information that you seek to know, but option 6 asks you
questions about donations. You will be asked a question if you want to donate money or not, you
can enter the answer as yes or no. After entering yes, it will ask you the amount of money (a
number), then you can enter a number and for the amount of money you have entered, it will
display the message and give you a donation link to donate money. You can see the same option
in the Tourism menu option, as the 1st option, however, it works quite differently. It asks the
same question, and if you enter yes, then the amount of money you would like to donate. Then it
asks you if you want to donate more money or not, if you enter yes, it will add 10% of the money
you have entered for an extra donation. Also, there is a little surprise you can expect after you
enter yes for that question. You will be eligible for a lucky draw if you are a tourist and you are
willing to donate money. If you enter yes after seeing the message about the lucky draw, you can
see your draw gift.
The options in Health menu are highly informative, therefore, if you want to know
information about anything health-related, you can choose the options and it will display the
facts or information about it. After choosing options every time, you will be asked if you want to
go back to the main menu or not, if you enter yes, you can see that, there are 7 other options you
can use.
If you want to know more information you can enter “information” to see, or anything
about a job, volunteering, and work-related. However, interview, donations, and save options
work a little differently than just being informative. If you choose the interview option, you will
be asked a question about your opinion and it will ask for your consent. if you enter yes, the
program will display the three questions, and ask for your answers. If you don’t want to answer
any of these questions, you can simply type no, but if you like to answer them, you can enter
one-word answers or sentences as well. After you enter answers for all of the questions, it will
display the answer you have typed and store your answers in a save.txt file that the program
created by itself after you answered your last question.
After that, you can choose another option from the main menu, such as to save or
donations. If you choose donations, it will ask you the same question, if you enter yes, it will ask
you the amount of money you are considering to donate. This option has been added into
Tourism and Protesting menu options as well, to encourage the users to donate for the people in
need of help, and if the user wants to know about the donation website without using any of
these options, the user simply can choose the option from the main menu.
For the last and important function, you can use the save option from the main menu. It
will ask you the topics or things you would like to save and keep them to yourself. You can
either save one of the files, or all of them if you like to and after you enter the names, it will
automatically create a text file called save and put your age, full name, interview answers (if you
have answered) and the information you choose from the save option in the main menu.
Finally, you will be asked again, if you want to go back to the main menu and use any of
the menu options. If you enter no this time, it will ask you a question. You will be asked about a
summary of program usage and your name to enter again. You can see the numbers of times, you
have used Protest, Tourism, or Health class, and It will also add that summary information into
your save.txt file. Once you have finished using and entering your information into a summary,
in the end, the program will display the goodbye message
